# Saint Louis Senegal Model Implementation
N_v: human population size in each village

P_v: total number of parasites in human hosts in each village

S_w: susceptible snails in freshwater source

E_w: exposed snails in freshwater source

I_w: infected snails in freshwater source

C_w: concentration of cercariae in freshwater source

M_w: concentration of miracidia in freshwater source

P_v: total number of adult parasites 

μ_H: natural human host mortality

μ_P: per capita parasite mortality 

ν: intrinsic natality rate

γ_w: site-specific effect of density dependence 

μ_s: mortality rate of susceptible snails

ρ: exposure rate of susceotible snails

1/δ: delay between infection (S-> E) and onset of infectiousness (E -> I)

η: disease-induced death rate infected snails are subject to

μ_C: uniform mortality rate of cercariae

ζ:  rate at which cercariae are shed from infected snails

μ_M: uniform mortality rate of miracidia

χ: human contamination rate

G_w: (χ/2V_w)(Σ(v=1, n_v)P_vΩ_uw

N_v= μ_H (H_v -N_v) - αP_v
