# Urinary Schistosomiasis Research

Olivia Kern's urinary schistosomiasis research.

## Variables

The variables which I am interested in modeling are:

- Variable 1: description of why I think this should be relevant
- Variable 2: same thing...
- ...
- ...

## Correlation Between Variables

From what I've noticed, var1 is highly correlated with var2, since blablabla...

Additionally, varX and varY **should** be correlated, since blablabla...

## Modeling

### Var1 and Var2 Relation

With this simple model, I want to try and explain the behavior of blablabla, and blablabla.

The code to produce this plots can be found in `model1code.py`.

### Second model

Same thing, with descriptions and plots and the maths...
