\title{Schistosomiasis Transmission in Togo's Ogou District}
Togo project notes

Mortality rate estimates for schistosomiasis remain unclear/noisy

The annual death rate is estimated to be between 6.9 deaths/ 1000 people per year

                                                                             8.69 deaths/ 1000 people per year

Average life expectancy is 65 years (CIA world factbook)

logical statement of a given person's compliance to MDA. 
%ratio is a probability sum of the events number of combinations is probability 
%defines the possible outcomes. highlight the 
%propositional (statements) logic

(\ref{eq:probMDA})


Because a true value for each element corresponds to a value of 1,
 %, and there are two possible outcome for each element (True=1 or False=0) 
  given factors $a$, $r$, $f$ is $\frac{1}{2^4}$ or $\frac{1}{16}$.

%Want to place MDA delivery in the context of local ecological transmission networks/pathways through the following:
%How does MDA compliance (% of population compliant) affect schistosomiais infection levels?
 %I want to be able to express the importance of number of present (1,2,3,4,5,6) persons in the household through a multipyling factor of the probability
%Distribution activities are supposed to take place over the course of one month (=/- 15 days) there is a maximum of 30/182.5 days allocated for distribution

%proximity to villages
%human infection rates at USP and village level
%snail collection at these {w
%snail classification and diagnostics to determine snail infection load at given site
%trasnmission dynamics via hydrological transport of schistosome larvae.

%It is important to account for/consider the number of Ghanian immigrants belonging to the () culture who join the community given without having received preventative chemotherapy, increasing the susceptible human population

Until now, MDA has been the sole intervention used for Schistosomiasis control in Togo and 
it may be desireable to explore the implementation of addtional strategies for Schistosomiasis control, focused on snail to human transmission dynamics. 

Given the challenges of achieving high coverage rates and therefore high rates of control with MDA alone, Many recent studies(cite) have highlighted the effectiveness of a combination of MDA and snail control strategies for Schistosomiasis control.

The system of differential equations is expressed in terms of the human population size $N_v$ and the total number of parasites $P_v$ within human hosts living in each village $_v$, the density of susceptible, exposed, and infectious snails $S_w$, $E_w$, $I_w$ in the freshwater point $_w$, and the concentration of cercariae $C_w$ and miracidia $M_w$ in the freshwater body.
$n_v$ villages and $n_w$ water points
The first equation (\ref{eq:PopRateofChange}) describes the rate of human population change in endemic villages. the per capita natality rate $\mu_H$ represents population growth, to which I incorporated a variable $\iota_H$ representing net migration given the importance of an influx of untreated persons to the transmission dynamics
 offset by parasite-incduced death given $\alpha$ parasitic pathogenicity.
including the mating pair dynamics (?) and the impact of poor sanitation (variable)
This $N_v$ is the symbol for the population...
