\maketitle
 
Here I apply a set of ordinary differential equations adapted from Soklow et al. 2017 to which I have added ($\iota$,y,z) to reflect local dynamics observed during fieldwork contributing to Schistosomiasis transmission in Ogou. I also developed an equation to describe the likelihood of mass drug administration (MDA) success as a function of the variables $f$, $a$, $p$, $unknown$ affecting treatment compliance.

presence and awake, history of adverse reactions, having eaten something on any given distribution day 
treatable population is defined as modified by incorporating (iota and ?) to fit the particular setting in Togo's Ogou district. I incorporated ... term into Eq (\ref{eq:PopRateofChange})  to reflect a consistent number of Ghanian immigrants belonging to the () culture who may have joined the community without having received preventative chemotherapy, increasing the susceptible human population
phenomenon observed during fieldwork. 
Adapted a nonlinear model  accounting for snail dispersal


The first equation (\ref{eq:PopRateofChange}) describes the rate of human population change in endemic villages. the per capita natality rate $\mu_H$ represents population growth, to which I incorporated a variable $\iota$ representing net migration given the importance of an influx of untreated persons to the transmission dynamics
 offset by parasite-incduced death given $\alpha$ parasitic pathogenicity.
including the mating pair dynamics (?) and the impact of poor sanitation (variable)
This $N_v$ is the symbol for the population...

\begin{equation}\label{eq:PopRateofChange}
\dot{N}_v = \mu_H\iota(H_v - N_v) - \alpha P_v
\end{equation}
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:ParasiteRateofChange}
 \dot{P}_v = F_vN_v - (\mu_H + \mu_P + \alpha)P_v - \alpha \frac{k +1}{k} \frac{P_v^2}{N_v}
 \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:SusceptibleRateofChange}
\dot{S}_w = vS_w [1- \gamma_w (S_w + E_w + I_w)] - \mu_S S_w - \rho M_wS_w + D_w^s
 %$\mathscr{D}$
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ExposedRateofChange}
\dot{E}_w = \rho M_wS_w - (\mu_s +\eta) I_w + D_w^E
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:InfectedRateofChange}
\dot{I}_w = \delta E_w - (\mu_s +\eta) I_w + D_w^I
\end{equation}
  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CercariaeRateofChange}
\dot{C}_w = \zeta I_w - \mu_cC_w+  L_w^I
 %$\mathscr{L}$
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MiracidiaRateofChange}
\dot{M}_w = \varrho M_w +  L_w^M
 %$\mathscr{L}$
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ForceofInfection}
 F_v = \beta \sum_{j=1}^{n_w} \Omega_vw C_w
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:contact matrix}
 F_v = \beta \sum_{j=1}^{n_w} \Omega_vw C_w
