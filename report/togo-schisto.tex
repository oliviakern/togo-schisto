\title{Modeling Schistosomiasis Transmission in Togo's Ogou District}
\author{Olivia Kern\\
Fulbright Student | Togo, 2017} 
 
\maketitle \textbf{Background}

Despite six years of continuous mass drug administration (MDA) activities at the national level, prevalence of three neglected tropical diseases--Schistosomiasis, Soil-transmitted Helminths and Onchocerciasis--has increased in Togo's Ogou district. Determining the factors contributing to low rates of MDA success is key to improving the outcomes of future control programs. I followed MDA activities across six villages in two peripheral health units (USP) and generated a (descriptor) probabilistic model  ($S_{MDA}$) based on my observations to assess the logical statement of a given person's compliance to MDA. 
%ratio is a probability sum of the events number of combinations is probability 
%defines the possible outcomes. highlight the 
%propositional (statements) logic
Let a person be eligible for MDA if 
boolean model

 C_{MDA} = p \wedge a \wedge r \wedge f

 %a (2 values) & r (2 values) & f (2 values) = 8 possible combinations.
 %the togolese ministry of health mandates each individual to consume the full dose of preventative chemotherapy distributed during MDA in front of the community health worker responsible for distribution. 
 For a person to be eligible for MDA compliance, he or she must be present in his or her own household during PZQ distribution activities and have true values for all elements $a$ (wakefulness), $r$ (no past adverse reaction to Praziquantel) and $f$ (meal within 4 hours before MDA) and have taken the full required d. Because a true value for each element corresponds to a value of 1,
 %, and there are two possible outcome for each element (True=1 or False=0) 
 the likelihood of  MDA compliance for an individual who is successfully reached by a community health worker given factors $a$, $r$, $f$ is $\frac{1}{8}$.

%-------------part 2
Until now, MDA has been the sole intervention used for Schistosomiasis control in Togo. Given the challenges of achieving high coverage rates and therefore high rates of control with MDA alone, it may be desireable to explore the implementation of addtional strategies for Schistosomiasis control, focused on snail to human transmission dynamics. Many recent studies(cite) have highlighted the effectiveness of a combination of MDA and snail control strategies for Schistosomiasis control. 

To simulate the benefits of such interventions for control in Ogou,  I will apply a set of ordinary differential equations adapted from Ciddio et al. 2017 which model the dynamics of Schistosomiasis transmission between snail and human populations. I have incorporated my own unique variables to reflect local phenomena affecting infection rates observed during my fieldwork in Ogou. These are $\iota_H$ representing net immigration into Ogou, which we assume is $>$0 given a stable influx of Ghanian immigrants into the region (\ref{eq:PopRateofChange}) %; $var2$

%It is important to account for/consider the number of Ghanian immigrants belonging to the () culture who join the community given without having received preventative chemotherapy, increasing the susceptible human population


The system of differential equations is expressed in terms of the human population size $N_v$ and the total number of parasites $P_v$ within human hosts living in each village $_v$, the density of susceptible, exposed, and infectious snails $S_w$, $E_w$, $I_w$ in the freshwater point $_w$, and the concentration of cercariae $C_w$ and miracidia $M_w$ in the freshwater body.
$n_v$ villages and $n_w$ water points
The first equation (\ref{eq:PopRateofChange}) describes the rate of human population change in endemic villages. the per capita natality rate $\mu_H$ represents population growth, to which I incorporated a variable $\iota_H$ representing net migration given the importance of an influx of untreated persons to the transmission dynamics
 offset by parasite-incduced death given $\alpha$ parasitic pathogenicity.
including the mating pair dynamics (?) and the impact of poor sanitation (variable)
This $N_v$ is the symbol for the population...

\begin{equation}\label{eq:PopRateofChange}
\dot{N}_v = \mu_H\iota_H(H_v - N_v) - \alpha P_v
\end{equation}
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:ParasiteRateofChange}
 \dot{P}_v = F_vN_v - (\mu_H + \mu_P + \alpha)P_v - \alpha \frac{k +1}{k} \frac{P_v^2}{N_v}
 \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:SusceptibleRateofChange}
\dot{S}_w = vS_w [1- \gamma_w (S_w + E_w + I_w)] - \mu_S S_w - \rho M_wS_w + D_w^s
 %$\mathscr{D}$
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ExposedRateofChange}
\dot{E}_w = \rho M_wS_w - (\mu_s +\eta) I_w + D_w^E
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:InfectedRateofChange}
\dot{I}_w = \delta E_w - (\mu_s +\eta) I_w + D_w^I
\end{equation}
  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CercariaeRateofChange}
\dot{C}_w = \zeta I_w - \mu_cC_w+  L_w^I
 %$\mathscr{L}$
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MiracidiaRateofChange}
\dot{M}_w = \varrho M_w +  L_w^M
 %$\mathscr{L}$
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ForceofInfection}
 F_v = \beta \sum_{j=1}^{n_w} \Omega_vw C_w
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:contact matrix}
 F_v = \beta \sum_{j=1}^{n_w} \Omega_vw C_w

\section{Equation Example}

A typical Linear-Time invariant (LTI) system can be described by the equation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ltiSys}
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{u}(t),
\end{equation}

in which ${\mathbf{x}}(t)$ represents the system's state vector, $\mathbf{A}$ denotes the system matrix that models the interaction between variables, $\mathbf{B}$ the way in which the inputs affect the different states, and $\mathbf{u}(t)$ the chosen control action at time $t$.

This way of expressing an LTI system yields a deterministic equation. Since I am interested in working with stochastic processes, I chose to add an additional term to this equation. The modified equation  looks like

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ltiSysStochastic}
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{u}(t) + \underbrace{ \mathbf{B}_w \mathbf{w}(t)}_{\text{random noise variable}},
\end{equation}

in which the additional term is a factor of two variables:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{w}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n} &: \text{white uncorrelated random noise variable} \\
\mathbf{B}_w \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n} &: \text{matrix that denotes which states are corrupted by noise}
\end{align*}


The reason behind the addition of the variables $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is that in real life scenarios, our sensors are not able to tell us with $100\%$ accuracy what the actual state of our variables are. Ancillary, if we are controling a system, it is unavoidable that the control input commanded from our computers --- e.g., the force or torque to be produced at a certain axis --- will not be exactly the same as the one produced by our actuators, and there is bound to be some uncertainty there as well. By including this random variable in the equation, and giving it the appropriate noise characteristics and behaviour that accuratelly describes the statistical behavior of our system, we can obtain a stochastic model.
